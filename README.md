This program is great for anyone that wants to create python projects both webscraping and graphical interface using pyqt5.
It is a work in progress but as time permits, I will add in more functionality and improve the code further. If you find or have any suggestions, I'm all ears.

This version v1.1 creates : 
GUI
- Pyqt5 GUI with a minimal template.
- It can also convert UI and QRC files to py for easy importing and packaging
- You can also run your project in using this program
- If duplicate project found, without modifying any code it will open the project folder for you and import the files for run or editing
SCRAPING

- Selenium Functionality is coming soon.
